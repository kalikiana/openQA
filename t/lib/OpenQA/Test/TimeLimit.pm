=head1 NAME

OpenQA::Test::TimeLimit - Limit test runtime

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenQA::Test::TimeLimit '42';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This aborts a test if the specified runtime limit in seconds is
exceeded.

Example output for t/basic.t:

  t/basic.t .. run... failed: test exceeds runtime limit of '1' seconds

Example output for t/full-stack.t:

  ok 1 - assets are prefetched
  [info] [pid:4324] setting database search path to public when registering Minion plugin
  [info] Listening at "http://127.0.0.1:35182"
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:35182
  Bailout called.  Further testing stopped:  get: Server returned error message test exceeds runtime limit of '6' seconds at /home/okurz/local/os-autoinst/openQA/t/lib/OpenQA/SeleniumTest.pm:107
  Bail out!  get: Server returned error message test exceeds runtime limit of '6' seconds at /home/okurz/local/os-autoinst/openQA/t/lib/OpenQA/SeleniumTest.pm:107

=head2 Alternatives considered

* Just checking the runtime while not aborting the test â€“ this idea has
not been followed as we want to prevent any external runners to run into
timeout first which can cause less obvious results
* https://metacpan.org/pod/Time::Limit - nice syntax that inspired me to
use a parameter on import but fails to completely stop tests including
all subprocesses
* https://metacpan.org/pod/Time::Out - applies a timeout to blocks, not
a complete module
* https://metacpan.org/pod/Time::SoFar - easy and simple but not
providing enough value to include
* https://metacpan.org/pod/Acme::Time::Baby - Just kidding ;)
